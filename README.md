# MEDICINE_PREDICTION

The Model File contains the Dataset which is used in the machine learning model.

This Machine Learning Model uses the most basic Machine Learning Algorithm called K Nearest Neighbour resulting in the 95% accuracy of the machine learning model.

This Machine Learning Model Predicts the Medicine for the Diseases like, fever, headache, etc.

The Dataset is Collected and Maintained by me and thus it is not available even in kaggle or google dataset.

This GIT rep is currently On-AIR in Heroku server as a API
